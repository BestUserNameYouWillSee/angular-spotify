 angular project wIth a spotIfy API

# Log
Day 1:
Started by making a new Angular project. Deleted the welcome screen so I could start with my own project. I couldn't get a token to connect with the spotify API so I had to look those things up. After awhile I got a token which I used to connect with the spotify API and used It to get Information about new releases. I did a bit of styling so it didn't look bad.

Day 2:
Changed the styling for my home page to something that looks more presentable. Added Angular Material and I made a sidenav with it, I also added icons with Angular Material.

Day 3:
Made a search page in which you can search for artists. You can't go to the specific artist yet.

# Problems
you can't use the spotify API on firefox. I don't know the reason for this, but I'm guessing it's because it's blocked in localhost.

You can't use the buttons next to the searchbar yet.
